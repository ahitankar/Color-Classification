# Color-Classification

A color classification model that tells us a dominant "R/G/B" color in the input image made using Tensorflow and Keras. 

I used Tensorflow library to make a deep learing model using keras as a high level api and to take input using ImageDataGenerator.

To run this project on your on machine import following packages:
1. python 3.6
2. Tensorflow 2.0
3. pillow
4. Matplotlib
5.Keras
6.Numpy

Make a separate virtual environment for the project. If running on Jupyter NoteBook then please check the size alloted to your notebook otherwise the project will not show the proper accuracy due to less space alloted to notebook.

Steps Involved in the Data Science projects are as follows:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Data Augmentation
3. Data Pipelining
4. Model creation
5. Model compilation
6. Testing model
7. Predicting output.
